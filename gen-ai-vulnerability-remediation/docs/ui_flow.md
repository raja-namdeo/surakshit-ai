## Mobile Responsive Behavior

The dashboard UI is designed to be responsive across different device sizes:

- On desktop: Tabs are displayed horizontally at the top of the page
- On mobile: Tabs stack vertically for easier touch interaction
- File upload and GitHub integration components adjust their layout for smaller screens
- Vulnerability reports collapse to a more compact view on mobile devices

## Accessibility Considerations

- Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Screen reader friendly with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Focus states are clearly visible for keyboard navigation
