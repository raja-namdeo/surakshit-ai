# Execution Guide - Generative AI for Security Vulnerability Remediation

This document provides detailed instructions for setting up and running the Generative AI for Security Vulnerability Remediation system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** (v6.x or higher)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **MongoDB** (optional, for production use)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gen-ai-vulnerability-remediation.git
cd gen-ai-vulnerability-remediation
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp config/config.env.example config/config.env
# Edit config.env with your preferred text editor to set required variables
```

Important environment variables to configure:
- `PORT`: The port on which the backend server will run (default: 5000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'development' for development mode or 'production' for production
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required for AI functionality)

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

#### Start the Backend Server

```bash
# From the backend directory
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server with nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm start
```

This will start the React development server, typically on port 3000.

### Production Mode

#### Build the Frontend

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

#### Start the Production Server

```bash
# From the backend directory
npm start
```

In production mode, the backend server will serve the static frontend files from the build directory.

## Accessing the Application

- Development mode: Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`
- Production mode: Access the application at `http://your-server-address:5000`

## Testing the Application

### Running Backend Tests

```bash
# From the backend directory
npm test
```

### Running Frontend Tests

```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend server won't start**
   - Check if the required environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure the specified port is not already in use
   - Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly

2. **Frontend development server won't start**
   - Check for errors in the terminal output
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
   - Verify that the backend server is running if the frontend depends on it

3. **AI functionality not working**
   - Verify that you've set a valid OpenAI API key in the environment variables
   - Check the backend logs for any API-related errors

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide, please:

1. Check the project's GitHub issues to see if the problem has been reported
2. Consult the project documentation
3. Open a new issue on GitHub with detailed information about the problem

## Deployment

For deploying to production environments, consider the following options:

### Docker Deployment

A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are provided for containerized deployment:

```bash
# Build and start containers
docker-compose up -d
```

### Cloud Deployment

The application can be deployed to various cloud platforms:

- **AWS**: Deploy using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2
- **Google Cloud**: Deploy using App Engine or Compute Engine
- **Azure**: Deploy using App Service or Virtual Machines
- **Heroku**: Deploy using the Heroku CLI

Detailed deployment instructions for specific platforms are available in the `/docs/deployment` directory.
