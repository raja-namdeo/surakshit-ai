# Vulnerability Scanning Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the vulnerability scanning features of Surakshit AI.

## Scanning Methods

Surakshit AI supports three main scanning methods:

1. **Web Application Scanning**: Dynamic scanning of live web applications using OWASP ZAP
2. **GitHub Repository Scanning**: Static analysis of code from GitHub repositories
3. **Codebase Scanning**: Static analysis of uploaded codebases (ZIP files)

## Scan Profiles

Each scanning method can use different scan profiles optimized for specific types of applications:

| Profile | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Web Application | Comprehensive scan for web applications | General-purpose websites |
| API | Focused scan for REST APIs | API endpoints and services |
| Mobile Backend | Security scan for mobile app backends | Mobile application servers |
| E-commerce | Specialized scan for e-commerce applications | Online stores and payment systems |
| Quick Scan | Fast scan with limited scope | Initial assessment |
| Thorough Scan | Comprehensive scan with all available scanners | Detailed security audit |

## Web Application Scanning

Web application scanning uses OWASP ZAP to perform dynamic analysis of running web applications.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Select "URL" as the scan source
3. Enter the target URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
4. Choose a scan profile (e.g., "Web Application")
5. Click "Start Scan"

### Example:

To scan an e-commerce website:
- URL: `https://myonlinestore.com`
- Profile: "E-commerce"
- Scan Type: "Full"

This will perform a comprehensive scan tailored for e-commerce applications, checking for vulnerabilities like:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure Direct Object References
- Payment-related vulnerabilities

## GitHub Repository Scanning

GitHub repository scanning clones a repository and performs static code analysis to find vulnerabilities.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Select "GitHub" as the scan source
3. Enter the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo`)
4. Choose a scan profile based on the repository type
5. Click "Start Scan"

### Example:

To scan a Node.js API repository:
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/username/node-api`
- Profile: "API"
- Scan Type: "Full"

This will analyze the codebase for:
- Insecure coding patterns
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Authentication issues
- Authorization flaws
- Data validation problems

## Codebase Scanning

Codebase scanning allows you to upload and analyze your own code.

### Steps:

1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Select "Upload" as the scan source
3. Click "Choose File" and select your codebase ZIP file
4. Choose a scan profile based on the codebase type
5. Click "Start Scan"

### Example:

To scan a Java web application:
- Upload: `myapp.zip` (containing a Java web application)
- Profile: "Web Application"
- Scan Type: "Thorough"

This will perform a comprehensive analysis of the Java codebase, checking for:
- Security vulnerabilities in the code
- Outdated and vulnerable dependencies
- Configuration issues
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Input validation problems

## Interpreting Scan Results

After a scan completes, you'll see a list of detected vulnerabilities with the following information:

- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Info
- **Type**: The category of vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS)
- **Location**: Where the vulnerability was found
- **Description**: Details about the vulnerability
- **Remediation**: Suggested fix for the vulnerability

### Vulnerability Details

Click on a vulnerability to see more details:

- **Evidence**: The specific code or request that triggered the finding
- **CWE ID**: Common Weakness Enumeration identifier
- **References**: Links to more information about the vulnerability
- **AI Remediation**: AI-generated fix recommendation

## Using AI Remediation

For each vulnerability, you can request AI-generated remediation:

1. Select a vulnerability from the list
2. Click "Generate Fix"
3. Review the suggested fix
4. Apply the fix to your codebase

## Advanced Scanning Options

### Custom Scan Parameters

You can customize scan parameters for more control:

1. Select a scan profile
2. Click "Customize"
3. Adjust parameters like:
   - Scan depth
   - Included scanners
   - Excluded paths
   - Authentication settings
4. Click "Apply" and start the scan

### Authenticated Scanning

For web applications requiring authentication:

1. Select "URL" as the scan source
2. Enter the target URL
3. Click "Authentication Settings"
4. Choose the authentication type:
   - Form-based
   - HTTP Basic
   - OAuth
5. Enter the required credentials
6. Click "Test Authentication" to verify
7. Start the scan

## Best Practices

- **Start with Quick Scans**: Use quick scans for initial assessment before running thorough scans
- **Scan in Development**: Integrate scanning into your development process to catch issues early
- **Regular Scanning**: Schedule regular scans of production applications
- **Focus on High Severity**: Address high and critical severity issues first
- **Verify Fixes**: Re-scan after applying fixes to ensure vulnerabilities are resolved

## Troubleshooting

### Scan Fails to Start

- Check that the target URL is accessible
- Verify that OWASP ZAP is running (for web application scans)
- Ensure GitHub repository URL is correct and accessible

### Scan Takes Too Long

- Try using a more focused scan profile
- Reduce the scan depth
- Exclude unnecessary paths from scanning

### False Positives

- Review the evidence carefully
- Use the "Mark as False Positive" option
- Provide feedback to improve future scans
