## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User accesses the dashboard through the React frontend
   - Initiates vulnerability scans or remediation actions

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Scanning service integrates with tools like OWASP ZAP
   - Scans target applications/code for security vulnerabilities
   - Results are stored and presented to the user

3. **AI Analysis**:
   - Vulnerability data is sent to the Generative AI module
   - AI analyzes vulnerabilities and generates remediation recommendations
   - Recommendations include code snippets and explanations

4. **Automated Remediation**:
   - User can select to apply AI-generated fixes
   - Remediation service applies changes to the codebase
   - Changes are verified and logged

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - User provides feedback on AI recommendations
   - Feedback is used to improve future recommendations
   - System learns from successful and unsuccessful remediations
