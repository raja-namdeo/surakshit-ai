# Generative AI for Security Vulnerability Remediation

A comprehensive tool that leverages Generative AI to detect, analyze, and remediate security vulnerabilities in applications and codebases.

## Overview

This project combines vulnerability scanning capabilities with AI-powered remediation to provide a complete security assurance solution. It helps developers and security teams identify vulnerabilities and fix them efficiently using AI-generated recommendations.

### Key Features

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrates with security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Generative AI to analyze vulnerabilities and generate remediation steps
- **Automated Remediation**: Applies AI-recommended fixes to vulnerabilities
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Provides a clear visualization of security posture
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves recommendations based on user feedback

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based user interface
- **Backend API**: Express.js server handling requests
- **Scanning Service**: Manages vulnerability scanning operations
- **AI Service**: Generates remediation recommendations
- **Remediation Service**: Applies fixes to vulnerabilities

For a detailed architecture diagram, see [Architecture Documentation](./docs/architecture.md).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- MongoDB (optional for production)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gen-ai-vulnerability-remediation.git
   cd gen-ai-vulnerability-remediation
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `backend/config/config.env.example` to `backend/config/config.env`
   - Update the environment variables as needed

## Usage

### Development Mode

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Mode

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

## User Guide

### Scanning for Vulnerabilities

1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Click on "Start Vulnerability Scan"
3. Enter the target URL or upload the codebase
4. Select the scan type (Quick, Full, or Custom)
5. Click "Start Scan"

### Viewing and Fixing Vulnerabilities

1. After a scan completes, view the list of detected vulnerabilities
2. Click on a vulnerability to see details and AI-generated recommendations
3. Review the recommended fix
4. Click "Apply Fix" to automatically remediate the vulnerability
5. Verify the fix was successful
